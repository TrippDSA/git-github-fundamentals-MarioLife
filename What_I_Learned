After reading the fundamentals README, I feel more comfortable with the GitHub syntax. 
However, the one thing I have always struggled to comprehend (even at work) is how GitHub is used with code (such as RStudio code) and Tableau to allow for collaboration.
I understand that it is the point of GitHub, but it has never been explained to me how that works in a real-world environment, which makes every depository I've used go way over my head.
I am hoping to learn how to properly use GitHub at some point with my work code and dashboards, and hopefully this project helps with that.
